The reason behind this project was showing hospitals which have the most patient,
so in case if anyone wants to visit the hospital, they can find the hospital with a minimum number of patients, 
this will help hospital staff and the patient as well.
This project was done by using python libraries such as Pandas and Folium and JSON files for data collections.
